Exhibits RNA polymerase II transcription factor binding activity. Is involved in negative regulation of dauer larval development\; negative regulation of pri-miRNA transcription by RNA polymerase II\; and regulation of development, heterochronic. Localizes to cytoplasm and nucleus. Is expressed in head\; hyp7 syncytium\; and pharyngeal muscle cell.
